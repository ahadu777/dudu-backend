# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## 🎯 INTEGRATION PROOF COMPLETE

**We solved the "last mile" gap between working APIs and consumer integration.**

- **📖 Story Runbooks** (`docs/integration/`) - Copy-paste commands for each story
- **🧪 Newman E2E Tests** (`npm run test:e2e`) - Automated story validation
- **💻 TypeScript SDK + Examples** (`examples/`) - Frontend integration proof
- **📊 Accurate Dashboard** (50% completion, not 47%)

**For complete context:** Read [`docs/INTEGRATION_PROOF.md`](docs/INTEGRATION_PROOF.md)

## 🚨 FRESH AI: READ THIS FIRST

### The #1 Rule: Check What Exists FIRST, Then Choose Workflow

**STEP 0: Always check existing implementations first**
- Check `docs/stories/_index.yaml` for existing stories AND relationship metadata
- Look for working examples in `examples/`
- Review "What's Actually Done" section below
- Search for existing cards in `docs/cards/`

**STEP 0.5: Query Relationship Metadata (CRITICAL)**
- Read `_index.yaml` for sequence dependencies, enhances/enhanced_by relationships
- Check card frontmatter for relationships metadata (depends_on, triggers, integration_points)
- Validate sequence constraints before implementing
- Identify implicit dependencies and cross-story impacts

**If functionality already exists** → **EXISTING WORK WORKFLOW**
- Point user to existing implementation
- Test/demonstrate current functionality
- Update documentation if needed

**If user describes NEW functionality** → **COMPLETE AUTONOMY WORKFLOW**
- Start with story analysis (NEVER jump to code)
- Create cards before implementing
- Document everything first

**If user references specific existing work** → **TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW**
- Work with existing stories/cards
- Update documentation as needed

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: How to Recognize What Type of Request This Is

### Request Classification (MUST READ FIRST)

**When user says things like:**
- "I want users to be able to..."
- "Add a feature where..."
- "Users should be able to..."
- "I need functionality for..."
- "Create a way for users to..."

➜ **THIS IS A RAW USER STORY** → Use **COMPLETE AUTONOMY WORKFLOW**

**When user says things like:**
- "Implement card XYZ"
- "Work on the existing story ABC"
- "Fix the bug in endpoint DEF"
- "Update the existing card..."

➜ **THIS IS TECHNICAL WORK** → Use **TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW**

---

## Quick Reference - What Actually Works

### The NEW Magic Formula (with Stories)
```
Story (Business) → Cards (Technical) → Code → Build → Test → Done
```

### 🔥 COMPLETE AUTONOMY WORKFLOW (For Raw User Stories)
**TRIGGER:** User describes a feature/functionality they want
**NEVER SKIP TO IMPLEMENTATION - ALWAYS START WITH STORY ANALYSIS**

**STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:**

**Step 1: Story Analysis**
```bash
# Read the template first
cat docs/templates/STORY_ANALYSIS.md
# Create story file: docs/stories/US-XXX-[story-name].md
# Apply template to break down user story into business requirements
```

**Step 2: Create Cards**
```bash
# Read the template first
cat docs/templates/CARD_TEMPLATE.md
# Create card files: docs/cards/[card-slug].md
# Generate technical specs following existing patterns
```

**Step 3: Document Everything**
```bash
# Update story index: docs/stories/_index.yaml
# Add story → card mappings
# Ensure all documentation is complete BEFORE coding
```

**Step 4: Implement Code**
```bash
# Update card status to "In Progress"
# Follow proven card-based development in /src/modules/
# Build and test: npm run build && npm start
```

**Step 5: Integration Proof**
```bash
# Create runbooks: docs/integration/US-XXX-runbook.md
# Add Newman tests: docs/postman_e2e.json
# Generate TypeScript examples: examples/
```

**Step 6: Validation**
```bash
npm run validate:integration
npm run test:e2e
node scripts/story-coverage.mjs
```

### TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW (When cards already exist)
**TRIGGER:** User references existing stories/cards or asks for specific technical work
**PROCESS:**
1. **You paste story content** (or point to file)
2. **I update codebase** (stories + cards)
3. **I implement cards** (our proven workflow)
4. **We track coverage** (validation scripts)

### Essential Commands (Use These Exact Sequences)
```bash
# 1. Check progress (MULTIPLE dimensions)
node scripts/progress-report.js         # Card status
node scripts/story-coverage.mjs         # Story → Card coverage
node scripts/success-dashboard.js       # Foundation + story validation (ACCURATE 50%)
node scripts/implementation-validator.js # Comprehensive validation
npm run validate:integration            # Integration proof completeness

# 2. Build and restart
npm run build
pkill -f "node dist/index.js" 2>/dev/null
PORT=8080 npm start &
sleep 3

# 3. Test and validate
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz      # Basic health
npm run test:e2e                        # Complete E2E story validation
npm run example:us001                   # TypeScript SDK integration

# 4. Integration proof (for consumers)
cat docs/integration/US-001-runbook.md  # Copy-paste complete flow
npm run example:all                     # All stories demo
```

## AI Development Workflow

### Definition of Ready (DoR) - Before We Code
**Card Must Have:**
- [ ] Complete API contract (OAS fragment)
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies identified and available
- [ ] Domain types defined in `domain.ts`
- [ ] Mock data structure agreed

**System Must Have:**
- [ ] All dependent cards implemented
- [ ] Mock store supports required operations
- [ ] Error codes in catalog
- [ ] State transitions defined

### Definition of Done (DoD) - Completion Criteria
**Implementation:**
- [ ] Matches card spec exactly
- [ ] Uses domain.ts types (no ad-hoc types)
- [ ] Error responses follow catalog format
- [ ] State transitions validated
- [ ] Logging with proper event names

**Quality:**
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Endpoints respond correctly (curl test)
- [ ] Idempotency works where specified
- [ ] Mock data persists correctly

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Card status updated to "Done"
- [ ] Branch/PR info in frontmatter
- [ ] Newman report path updated

### Card-Based Development Process
1. **Verify DoR** - Check all prerequisites
2. **Update status** to "In Progress" in frontmatter
3. **Implement with mock data** using unified store
4. **Test the implementation** thoroughly
5. **Verify DoD** - Check all criteria met
6. **Update status** to "Done" when complete

### When Adding New Features
1. Check existing patterns in similar files
2. Follow TypeScript strict mode conventions
3. Add OpenAPI documentation for new endpoints
4. Create appropriate DTOs for validation
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Add logging with request IDs

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Implement proper TypeScript types (no `any`)
- Follow REST conventions for endpoints
- Return consistent JSON response formats
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Use Postman collections for API testing
- Health checks for monitoring

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit secrets (use .env files)
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Add authentication where needed
- Use helmet for security headers

### Performance Considerations
- Use compression middleware
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use database indexes
- Monitor with health endpoints
- Implement graceful shutdown

## Common Tasks

### Working with Cards (Primary Workflow)
1. **Check progress**: `node scripts/progress-report.js`
2. **Read card**: Check `/docs/cards/<slug>.md` for requirements
3. **Update status**: Change frontmatter status field
4. **Implement**: Follow card specifications exactly
5. **Test**: Verify with curl commands
6. **Complete**: Mark status as "Done"

### Adding a New Endpoint
1. Define in OpenAPI specification (if needed)
2. Create module in `/src/modules/<name>/`
3. Implement router with handlers
4. Add service logic if complex
5. Use mockDataStore for data operations
6. Test with curl commands

### Database Migrations
1. Create entity in `/src/models`
2. Generate migration: `npm run typeorm migration:generate`
3. Run migration: `npm run typeorm migration:run`

### Debugging
- Check logs with proper request IDs
- Use health endpoint for liveness
- Monitor Docker logs in production
- Use Swagger UI for API testing

## Notes for Claude - READ THIS FIRST

### What's Actually Done (Tested & Working)
1. **GET /catalog** - Returns active products
2. **GET /catalog/promotions/{id}** - Returns detailed promotion information (US-008)
3. **POST /orders** - Idempotent order creation
4. **POST /payments/notify** - Payment processing with sync ticket issuance
5. **Ticket Service** - Internal module for ticket generation

### Integration Proof Complete (NEW)
1. **Story Runbooks** - Copy-paste commands for all 9 user stories (`docs/integration/`)
2. **Newman E2E Tests** - Automated validation of complete flows (`npm run test:e2e`)
3. **TypeScript SDK** - Generated client + working examples (`examples/`)
4. **Accurate Dashboard** - True 50% completion using canonical cards
5. **Consumer Ready** - Frontend teams can integrate immediately

### The Proven Workflow
1. **Stories in** `/docs/stories/` (business requirements)
2. **Index in** `/docs/stories/_index.yaml` (maps stories → cards)
3. **Cards in** `/docs/cards/<slug>.md` (technical specs)
4. **Implementation:**
   - Update card status to "In Progress"
   - Code in `/src/modules/<name>/`
   - Use `mockDataStore` for all data
   - Build, restart, test with curl
   - Update card to "Done"

### Critical Success Patterns
- **Idempotency**: Check existing before creating
- **Synchronous calls**: Direct service calls, not events
- **Error handling**: Use `ERR` constants from `/src/core/errors/codes`
- **Logging**: JSON structured with `logger.info(event, data)`
- **Mock data**: Products 101-104 active, 105 inactive

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **Port in use**: `pkill -f "node dist/index.js"`
- **Not seeing changes**: Did you `npm run build`?
- **Server not starting**: Check port 8080, kill old processes

### Single Source of Truth Structure

scripts/
  progress-report.js      # Card status
  story-coverage.mjs     # Story coverage
  integration-proof-validator.js  # Drift detection
```

### SSoT Hierarchy (Lessons Learned)
When conflicts arise, resolve using this precedence:
1. **Cards** (`docs/cards/*.md`) = Technical endpoint contracts
2. **domain.ts** = Type definitions code compiles against
3. **OpenAPI 3.0.3** = Mirrors cards for tooling
4. **Examples/Tests** = Must align with above (auto-validated)

**Key Insight:** Integration examples can drift from specifications. Use validation scripts to detect and fix misalignments systematically.

## Complete Workflow: User Story → Implementation

### Phase 1: Story Analysis
**When:** Fresh user story without existing cards
**Process:**
1. Apply `docs/templates/STORY_ANALYSIS.md` template
2. Extract business rules and acceptance criteria
3. Identify API endpoints and data changes needed
4. Break down into implementable cards

**Example Input:** "I want users to cancel tickets and get refunds"
**Example Output:** 3 cards (ticket-cancellation, refund-processing, cancellation-policies)

### Phase 2: Card Generation
**Process:**
1. Use `docs/templates/CARD_TEMPLATE.md` structure
2. Assign to appropriate team (A/B/C) based on functionality
3. Write OpenAPI contracts following existing patterns
4. Define business rules as testable invariants
5. Plan database migrations and observability

**Quality Checks:**
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Ensure SSoT hierarchy compliance
- Add to story index mapping

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Process:**
1. **Update status** to "In Progress" in card frontmatter
2. **Implement code** following existing patterns in `/src/modules/`
3. **Use mock data** for development and testing
4. **Build and test** with curl commands
5. **Update status** to "Done" when complete

### Phase 4: Integration Proof Creation
**Process:**
1. **Create story runbook** in `docs/integration/US-XXX-runbook.md`
2. **Add Newman tests** to `docs/postman_e2e.json`
3. **Generate TypeScript example** in `examples/usXXX.ts`
4. **Update story index** to include new cards

### Phase 5: Validation
**Commands:**
```bash
npm run validate:integration    # Check integration proof completeness
npm run test:e2e               # Validate E2E story flows
npm run example:usXXX          # Test TypeScript integration
node scripts/success-dashboard.js  # Check overall progress
```

## Decision Trees for Fresh AI

### When to Create New vs Extend Existing Cards?
**Create New Card if:**
- New API endpoint with distinct business logic
- Different team responsibility area
- Independent functionality that stands alone

**Extend Existing Card if:**
- Adding field to existing endpoint
- Minor business rule change
- Same team/domain area

### How to Handle Card Dependencies?
**In Prerequisites Section:**
- List dependent cards that must be implemented first
- Specify external service requirements
- Document shared data structures

**In Implementation:**
- Check dependent card status before starting
- Use existing service patterns for integration
- Follow established error handling patterns

### API Design Decision Guidelines?
**Endpoint Structure:**
- Follow REST: `/resource/{id}/action`
- Use HTTP verbs correctly (POST for state changes)
- Group related operations under same resource

**Request/Response Format:**
- Follow existing domain.ts types
- Use consistent error response structure
- Include pagination for list endpoints

**Status Codes:**
- 200: Success with data
- 201: Created (for POST that creates)
- 400: Bad request format
- 401: Authentication required
- 404: Resource not found
- 409: Business rule conflict
- 422: Validation failed

## Example Prompts for Fresh AI

### Complete Feature Development (Full Autonomy)
```
"I want users to be able to [specific feature request]. Please analyze this as a user story, generate technical cards, implement the code, and create complete integration proof artifacts."

Examples:
- "I want users to be able to cancel their tickets and get a refund"
- "I want operators to scan QR codes and redeem tickets at events"
- "I want users to transfer tickets to other users"
- "I want to add discount codes and promotional pricing"
```

### Story Analysis (Starting Point)
```
"Analyze this user story using our systematic approach: [paste story content]"
"Break down this requirement into technical cards following our templates"
"What cards would you create for this user story: [description]"
```

### Card Implementation (Traditional Workflow)
```
"Implement the card: [card name or file path]"
"Please work on all pending cards and update their status"
"Show me the progress on cards and implement the next ready one"
"Implement the card: ticket-cancellation"
```

### Integration Proof Generation
```
"Create the frontend integration guide for our implemented features"
"Generate copy-paste runbook for story [US-XXX]"
"Update the Newman test collection with new story scenarios"
"Create TypeScript SDK examples for all working endpoints"
```

### Quality Validation & Progress
```
"Run our validation scripts and fix any issues found"
"Check integration proof completeness and update if needed"
"Validate that all stories have proper integration artifacts"
"What's our current progress across all stories and cards?"
"Show me which stories are ready for frontend integration"
"Generate the success dashboard report"
```

### Troubleshooting & Maintenance
```
"Fix any TypeScript compilation errors and restart the server"
"Update the Newman tests to match current API contracts"
"Check for integration proof drift and fix misalignments"
"Rebuild and test all examples to ensure they work"
```

### Best Practices for Fresh AI
1. **Always start with story analysis** when given raw requirements
2. **Query relationship metadata FIRST** - check `_index.yaml` and card frontmatter for dependencies, sequences, and integration points
3. **Use the validation scripts** (`npm run validate:integration`) after implementation
4. **Follow the SSoT hierarchy** (Cards → domain.ts → OpenAPI → Examples)
5. **Create integration proof** alongside code implementation
6. **Test with curl commands** before marking cards as "Done"
7. **Use existing patterns** from completed user stories (check `/docs/stories/_index.yaml` for current examples)
8. **Follow established card quality** seen in completed cards like `tickets-issuance`, `user-profile-endpoint`
9. **Check dependencies** - new stories may reference existing cards or create new dependencies

### Knowledge Graph Query Patterns (NEW)

**Before implementing any card, systematically check:**

1. **Story-Level Relationships** (`docs/stories/_index.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   # Check for sequence dependencies
   sequence: [catalog-endpoint → order-create → payment-webhook]
   # Check enhancement relationships
   enhances: [US-001]
   enhanced_by: [US-011]
   # Check implicit dependencies
   implicit_dependencies: [catalog-endpoint, promotion-detail-endpoint]
   ```

2. **Card-Level Relationships** (card frontmatter):
   ```yaml
   relationships:
     enhanced_by: ["complex-pricing-engine"]
     depends_on: ["catalog-endpoint"]
     triggers: ["payment-webhook"]
     data_dependencies: ["Product", "Order", "PricingContext"]
     integration_points:
       data_stores: ["data.ts", "store.ts"] # Critical for implementation
   ```

3. **Cross-Domain Impact Analysis**:
   - "What stories use this card?" → Search _index.yaml for card name
   - "What must happen before this?" → Check sequence and depends_on
   - "What does this trigger?" → Check triggers and enhanced_by
   - "What integration points exist?" → Check integration_points metadata

**Example Knowledge Graph Queries:**
```bash
# Before implementing order-create enhancement:
grep -A 10 "order-create" docs/stories/_index.yaml  # Find all stories using this card
grep -A 5 "relationships:" docs/cards/order-create.md  # Check relationship metadata
grep "integration_points" docs/cards/order-create.md  # Critical implementation details
```
