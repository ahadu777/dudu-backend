**Solution Overview**: Multi-channel inventory management system with dedicated OTA API endpoints, enabling external platforms to reserve and sell cruise packages while maintaining inventory separation and pricing consistency.

**Success Metrics**:
- 5000 package units allocated to OTA by Nov 15, 2025
- Zero inventory conflicts between sales channels
- <2 second API response times for OTA partners
- Revenue expansion through external channel partnerships

**Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (Inventory & Reservations): Delivered Nov 3, 2025 ✅
- Phase 2 (Order Fulfillment): Nov 4, 2025 🔄
- Phase 3 (Complete Integration): Nov 15, 2025 📋

## Business Rules & Logic

### Channel Allocation Strategy
- **Allocation Model**: Fixed allocation per product with real-time availability tracking
- **Product Distribution**:
  - Premium Plan (106): 2000 units OTA, 1000 units direct (66% OTA allocation)
  - Pet Plan (107): 1500 units OTA, 500 units direct (75% OTA allocation)
  - Deluxe Tea Set (108): 1500 units OTA, 300 units direct (83% OTA allocation)
- **Rationale**: Higher OTA allocation for premium products maximizes partnership value

### Pricing Consistency
- **Pricing Model**: Identical complex pricing across all channels (maintains PRD-001 strategy)
- **Price Points**:
  - Weekend premiums apply equally (+$30 for adults)
  - Customer type discounts consistent ($188 for child/elderly regardless of channel)
  - Special event pricing synchronized across channels
- **Currency**: HKD maintained across all channels

### Reservation Management
- **Reservation Rules**:
  - Maximum 100 units per reservation (prevents inventory hoarding)
  - 24-hour automatic expiry (balances flexibility with inventory efficiency)
  - No reservation fees (reduces partnership friction)
- **Activation Process**:
  - OTA payment notification triggers existing order creation flow
  - Reserved inventory converts to sold inventory atomically
  - QR codes generated and delivered to OTA platform
  - Integration with existing ticket fulfillment system
  - Reservation automatically converts to sale upon payment
  - Same ticket issuance system generates packages with entitlements

## Complete API Specification

### Phase 1: Inventory & Reservations (✅ Implemented)
```yaml
