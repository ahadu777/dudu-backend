# Deprecated PRDs

This directory contains PRDs that have been deprecated (merged, superseded, or abandoned).

## Purpose

- Preserve historical context and decision records
- Prevent conflicts with active PRDs
- Maintain traceability for merged features

## Naming Convention

Files retain their original names for traceability.

## Current Contents
