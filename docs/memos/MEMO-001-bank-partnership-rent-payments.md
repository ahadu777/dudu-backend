# Bank Partnership Value Proposition - Rent Payments

## Our Position

We provide issuer- and acquirer-native rental payment infrastructure, and an optional reward distribution layer that banks can plug into their existing campaigns.

## From the Branded Card and Bank Products

**Rent payments enabled on credit card:**
- Installment options (subject to bank rules)
- Eligibility for bank's existing:
  1. Cashback programs
  2. Points programs
  3. Installment campaigns
  4. Credit line management

## RewardKoi Contribution (Non-Bank-Funded)

RewardKoi ecosystem provides:
- Merchant-funded rewards
- Lifestyle benefits
- Partner vouchers
- Limited-time perks tied to rent payment behavior

**Examples (illustrative, not commitments):**
- Rent payment → lifestyle reward
- Auto-pay setup → partner voucher
- On-time rent history → premium RewardKoi access

## Why This Structure Works

- Rent becomes a default monthly card transaction
- Installments increase long-term card engagement
- RewardKoi rewards reduce "first-use friction"

## Bank Retains Full Control Of

- Credit terms
- Pricing
- Campaign design
- Compliance

## What the Bank Gains

**Sticky card usage from rent** (largest recurring expense)
- Higher installment penetration
- High-quality, behavior-based financial data

**Cross-sell opportunities across:**
- Credit products
- Insurance
- Other housing-related financial services

**All without:**
- Building rent infrastructure internally
- Changing existing product strategy
- Funding external reward programs
