# Medical PR Service Pricing Strategy - Hong Kong Market

## Context

Client inquiry: "我們想幫醫生宣傳，發布新聞稿給媒體放在他們網站或者 Facebook，你們有沒有做這些宣傳？"

**Key Insight**: If clients see this as "just writing articles," they'll think it's expensive. But if we position it as **"Compliant Medical Brand Asset Management"**, we can charge professional service premiums.

## 1. Internal Work Breakdown: What Are We Actually Selling?

Clients think we're just "writing and posting," but due to Hong Kong's strict《不良醫藥廣告條例》and Medical Council regulations, our actual work includes high-risk **"compliance filtering"** and **"reputation moat"** building.

| Work Phase | Internal Work Entailment | Value Proposition |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Topic & Compliance Review** | • **Medical regulation screening:** Check keywords for "guaranteed cure" or "exaggerated efficacy" red lines<br>• **Literature verification:** Find supporting medical journals (Lancet, NEJM) as endorsement<br>• **Doctor interview:** 30-min interview to extract doctor's personal touch | **Buying "Safety":**<br>Prevent doctors from receiving Medical Council warning letters or suspension risk |
| **2. Professional Medical Writing** | • **Translation:** Convert medical jargon (如「微創內視鏡黏膜下剝離術」) into patient-friendly language (「無痛除息肉」)<br>• **Soft placement:** Subtly embed doctor credentials in health education articles without looking like hard-sell ads | **Buying "Trust":**<br>Establish doctor as "KOL" authority in their field |
| **3. Media Negotiation & Distribution** | • **Press release distribution:** Operate Media OutReach or PR Newswire to ensure articles enter Google News and Yahoo Finance<br>• **Media buying:** Negotiate placements with HKET or Baby Kingdom (budget permitting) | **Buying "Visibility":**<br>Leverage major media SEO weight to rank doctor's name on Google page 1 |
| **4. Interaction Monitoring (Critical)** | • **Comment management:** Monitor Facebook comments. If someone asks "Does this doctor guarantee cure?", must reply with compliant language (cannot say Yes) to avoid legal issues | **Buying "Risk Control":**<br>Prevent malicious comments or improper replies from triggering PR disasters |

## 3. Sales Pitch Strategy

When client asks: "Do you do this kind of promotion?"—don't just answer "Yes." Use this logic:

### Script Template:

> "Dr. Chen / Manager, we don't just do promotion—we specialize in **'compliant medical content marketing.'**
>
> In Hong Kong, doctor advertising is strictly regulated by the Medical Council. If you just hire anyone to write press releases, it's easy to receive warning letters for improper wording (like using 'best' or 'authority').
>
> Our approach isn't 'advertising for you'—it's building your **'medical professional image.'** We will:
>
> 1. **Write regulation-compliant health education articles** that turn your expertise into news.
> 2. **Publish through authoritative channels (like Yahoo News)**, so when patients Google your name, they see news coverage—which has 3x higher trust than ads.
> 3. **Sync to Facebook**, and we'll filter sensitive medical comments to protect your license.
>
> We suggest starting with one press release per month, with basic social media maintenance. This accumulates online presence while staying absolutely safe. Here's our clinic-designed package (present HK$15,000/mo package)—does this direction match your expectations?"

## Action Plan Summary

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Positioning** | Not "Press Release Writing" → **"Medical Reputation Management" (醫療聲譽管理)** |
| **Entry Price** | Minimum threshold: **HK$12,000 - $15,000/month** (covers writing, distribution via Media OutReach/Merxwire, plus profit) |
| **Upsell** | For Ming Pao/HKET mainstream media: clearly communicate it's **Paid Media (advertising)**, HK$100,000+ starting, we can operate but charge separate service fee |
